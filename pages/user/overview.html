  <h2>What is Webshell?</h2>

  <p>HTTP based APIs are now an integral part the web , they even compose a coherent part of it we often call the programmable web. More than 8500 open APIs and their providers companies use the Web for content and information delivery through these APIs.
  In this growing part of the web, there are still several pain points for application developers attempting to integrate and script APIs for their applications.</p>

  <p>Most real-world client apps need to mashup multiple APIs in one go. APIs mashups are often complicated as client apps need to worry about :
    <ul>
      <li>- authentication protocol which often are not the same specs</li>
      <li>- endpoint description which oblige you to check the API documentation in depth to see each time at same functionalities between 2 APIs have not same method name</li>
      <li>- data format which oblige you to parse XML or JSON response from an API  to fit with the reception API when you make an API workflow</li>
      <li>- order of requests, inter-dependencies, error handling, and parallelization to reduce overall latency.</li>
      <li>- HTML views that you have always to re-invent the wheel</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>We are happy to present you webshell.io  – an API of APIs trough a Javascript, declarative, evented, data-retrieval and aggregation gateway for HTTP APIs, built on node.js. Through webshell.io, we want to help application developers to faster develop application using APIs for increasing improvement of end user experience and engineering clock speed.
  Webshell.io can reduce the number of lines of code required to call multiple HTTP APIs while simultaneously bringing down network latency and bandwidth usage in certain use cases, for mobile for example.</p>
  <p>Webshell.io consists of a top layer of node.js focused on APIs, transforming API endpoints into Javascript objects, inspired by UNIX shell scripting paradigm, and this node.js-based runtime will process webshell scripts written in Javascript or Coffeescript.</p>

<section id="why">
  <h2>Why using Webshell?</h2>


  <p>APIs are not always consistent as they evolve based on the API producers’ needs – which makes code noisier in order to normalize inconsistencies. (Authentication protocols, endpoints description, data format)
  RESTful APIs are fixed and can't be adapted to every use. You might end up doing a lot of transformation on the client side to assemble the info you want, and it might take several calls, causing latency
  Often those API requests have interdependencies – which requires programmatic orchestration of HTTP requests – making some requests in parallel and some in sequence to satisfy the dependencies and yet keep the overall latency low.
  Most use cases require accessing multiple APIs – which involves making several network round trips.</p>

  <p>With 100 news APIs per week and 1 000 000 expected for 2017 this will grow exponentianally.</p>

  <p>We found that these issues have three critical impacts: development time, end user experience and engineering clock speed</p>



  <p>Development time is too long for discovering and learning how to use APIs and make API workflows between different client side and server side APIs, authentication protocols, endpoint description and data format and then transforming the assembled data in server side code (PHP, python etc..) into Javascript for client side applications.<br />
  End user experience suffers due to high bandwidth usage as well as the latency caused by the number of requests and the processing overhead of non-optimized responses from APIs.</p>


  <p>Engineering clocks slow down because developers need to account for dependencies between API calls, and to arrange those calls to optimize overall latency. Implementing orchestration logic involves multi-threaded fork-join code, leads to code bloat, and distracts from the main business use case that the developer is striving to support.</p>


  <p>The goal of webshell.io is to ease three pain points:</p>



  <p>By transforming all API endpoints into javascript objects, it become easy for developers to integrate, combine and script any APIs together,  and assemble the data you want on the client-side code works is implicitly done.
  By using a Javascript interface to declare API calls, their interdependencies, you can cut down the number of lines of code from hundreds of lines to a few, and the development time from entire sprints to mere hours. Using Javascript, you can create new consumer-centric interfaces that are optimized for your application’s requirements.<br />
  You can use webshell.io as an HTTP gateway between client applications and API servers side or client side so that webshell.io can process and condense the data to just the fields that the client needs and also providing the viws that you don’t have to make again and again. This helps reduce the number of requests that the client needs to make as well as the amount of data transported to clients.</p>

  <h2>APIs endpoints as Javascript objects</h2>


  <p>The idea behind Webshell is that it is easier for developers to use and script APIs with the whole expressivity of a programming language for APIs than to make the traditionnal way using REST/JSON protocols.<br />
  Webshell has transformed every APIs endpoints into Javascript Objects,  via its builtins and file system.</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">var m = apis.google.maps({height: '500px'});
  m.center(args.city);
  m.zoom(12);

  var n = apis.facebook.getFriends();</pre>

  <p>Because lots of applications need a programming logic,  or because start-ups use many APIs logic into their code. For example,  Siri combines up to 55 APIs together (Speech to text, Natural language processing, POI database etc…) and if you use APIs as Objects, It will be easier to make so advanced applications.<br />
  We can now, thanks to webshell.io, really talk of programming the web.</p>

  <p>Why we have chosen Javascript?</p>

  <p>JavaScript has long been the de facto standard for client-side APIs and mashups with Googlemaps, Youtube etc... While nearly all client API code is written in JavaScript, server-side APIs like Twitter or Facebook can be called in PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and numerous other languages. Life as a web and mobile developer would be much simpler if a single language was used everywhere.<br />
  Because JavaScript dominates APIs in the browser , it makes sense to use it for server side APIs as well.<br />
  In the same way Node.js made Javascript the unique language to execute code server-side and client-side, Webshell, built on Node.js too, lets you call APIs with a single language : Javascript.</p>


  <p>Why we have chosen Node.js?</p>




  <p>Performance and scalability for I/O workloads.  Of workloads performed during script execution, a significant percentage  is I/O bound. CPU loads are limited to in-memory tasks like joining and projections. Blocking I/O was out of the equation for supporting such workloads.
  Operability. We need to be able to monitor the runtime, know what is going on, and react quickly when things go wrong. Furthermore, integrating with API logging and monitoring tools is a prerequisite for bringing in a new technology stack.</br />
  Low per-connection memory overhead. Since script execution involves some slow and some fast APIs, we need the stack to remain stable as the number of open connections increases.</p>

  <h2>Javascript as a Service</h2>

  <p>Classical APIs, called RESTAPIs takes usually nouns or verbs as parameter. (In fact they are RPC, but no place here for troll about it) Webshell is an original API which take as parameter Javascript code, in order to script APIs easily.</p>

  <code>http://api.webshell.io?code={code}&args={args}&output={output}&key={key}&secret={secret}</code>

  <p>Because Javascript, it enables developers to script APIs together in  and combine them easily, either server side (like facebook, Twitter, Spotify…) or client side (like Googlemaps, Google Chart, Youtube Player…)</p>

  <p>Then each script can be called :  
  - as a new independant REST/JSON API 
  - using Webshell REST API which will be processing your Javascript and giving you back the final answer in JSON if you use the SDK via a wsh.exec method Let’s take an example of a script logoOnMaps for placing a company logo onto a Google map. On Webshell Editor, you have to type this following documentations in the API explorer</p>


  <pre class="prettyprint">var m = apis.google.maps({height: '500px'});
  m.center(args.city);
  m.zoom(12);

  m.addMarker({
      address: 'palais brongniart',
      icon: apis.gravatar(args.mail, {view: null})
  });</pre>

  <p>One you have made this logoOnMaps script on the editor and pushed it, this script is now an API that can be called with the 2 manners described upper : </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
        by using the REST/JSON API : 
        [EXEMPLE URL api.webshell.io/?code=....]
    </li>
    <li>
      Or by using the Javascript SDK, or Node.js SDK you will send the Javascript code to Webshell platform and Webshell will send you the final answer in JSON.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <pre class="prettyprint">wsh.exec({
    code: function() {
      var m = apis.google.maps({height: '500px'});
      m.center('paris');
      m.zoom(18);
      m.addMarker({
       address:'palais brongniart',
       icon : apis.gravatar(args.mail, {view:null})
      },
      process: function(json, meta) {
        $('body').append(meta.view);
      }
    })
  })</pre>
